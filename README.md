# Introduction
Experiments with uvm_reg package. 

## Tests
Currently I modify the source code from [ClueLogic](https://github.com/cluelogic/uvm-tutorial-for-candy-lovers) tutorial 9 to create different versions of the register block.

## Setup
Source the setup.csh to setup the environment. You may need to modify it for your env. Then cd to the run directory.

```
source setup.csh
cd uvm-tutorial-for-candy-lovers/run
```

## Running 
To Run uvm_reg benchmark 1  use the following script. This will run all the data points serially and generate the result in *tutorial_1.dat*.
```
./run_tutorial_1
```


To Run the same benchmark 1 with srm reg package use the following script. This will run all the data points serially and generate the result in *tutorial_1.dat".
```
./run_tutorial_1
```
